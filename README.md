# Typescript Node Template

A template that uses typescript for node.

## Versioning

A version contains, major, minor, patch and build number.

Major can be increased when non-backward compatible changes are made.
Minor can be increased when features are added that don't affect backward compatibility.
Patch gets increased after each release (automatically done by GitHub Actions).
Build gets increased after each commit (automatically done by GitHub Actions).

The format is as follows.

`
%major%.%minor%.%patch%+%build number%
`
